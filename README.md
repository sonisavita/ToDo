 ToDo  App

A simple and responsive ToDo  web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
This project demonstrates how to create, update, and delete tasks using the DOM manipulation approach — without any external libraries or frameworks.

 Features
	•	 Add new tasks
	•	 Delete tasks
	•  Interactive UI using pure DOM manipulation

 Tech Stack
	•	HTML5 – Structure of the app
	•	CSS3 – Styling and layout
	•	JavaScript – Functionality & DOM operations

 Approach

This project is built using the Document Object Model (DOM) approach.
Instead of using frameworks like React or Vue, all UI updates and interactions (adding, editing and deleting tasks) are handled through JavaScript by dynamically manipulating HTML elements.

Key concepts used:
	•	document.querySelector() / getElementById()
	•	createElement() and appendChild()
	•	Event listeners (addEventListener)
	•	Updating the UI in real-time
